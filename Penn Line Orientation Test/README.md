# Penn Line Orientation Test (PLOT)
This script scores the 24-item PLOT administered on PsychoPy (Peirce et al. 2019). It requires the trials.xlsx file that indicates starting and taret positions for each trial, as well as a data folder with one raw output file per subject. It outputs the total correct, the total degrees off, and the number of the degrees off for each of the 24 trials.
